        <h2>Bounce Ball Game in Python</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            This is a Python based game containing 1 player 
            and running in the IDE console env. 
          </li>
          <li>
            I have used concepts like Tkinter module. The project 
            file only contais a python script. The gameplay graphics 
            is good enough and the controls are simple for the users.
            In order to run the project, you must have installed 
            Python on your PC.
